### Flashing the Board for Klipper

1. **Connect Hardware**  
   - Attach the board to the Raspberry Pi via USB.  
   - Ensure either the **5V jumper** is connected or **24V power** is supplied to the board.

2. **Access Raspberry Pi**  
   - Connect to the Raspberry Pi via SSH.

3. **Enter DFU Mode**  
   - Press and hold the **Boot** button.  
   - While holding **Boot**, press and release the **Reset** button.  
   - Release the **Boot** button. The board should now be in DFU mode.

4. **Verify DFU Mode**  
   - Run `lsusb` to ensure the STM32 device is listed in DFU mode.  
   - Run `dfu-util --list` and note the device identifier in `[xxxx:yyyy]`.

5. **Prepare Klipper Firmware**  
   - Navigate to the Klipper directory:  
     ```bash
     cd ~/klipper
     ```
   - Configure the build with `make menuconfig`:
     ![klipper_config](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6e841b0f-7c02-40d5-9c19-80252fefbbd7)

     - Ensure the settings match the provided configuration screenshot.
     - Press **Q** to exit and save changes.

6. **Build the Firmware**  
   - Clean the environment:  
     ```bash
     make clean
     ```  
   - Flash the firmware using the device identifier from Step 4:  
     ```bash
     make flash FLASH_DEVICE=xxxx:yyyy
     ```

7. **Finalize the Flashing**  
   - Press the **Reset** button to restart the board.

8. **Verify the Serial Connection**  
   - Run the following command to list serial devices:  
     ```bash
     ls /dev/serial/by-id/*
     ```  
   - Look for a device similar to:  
     ```
     /dev/serial/by-id/usb-Klipper_stm32f072x6...
     ```

9. **Update Configuration**  
   - Copy the serial port name (e.g., `/dev/serial/by-id/usb-Klipper_stm32f072x6...`).  
   - Add it to the `[FanMatrix mcu]` section in your Klipper configuration file.

10. **Include Example Config**  
    - Copy the example configuration file into the same directory as `printer.cfg`.  
    - Add the following line to the end of `printer.cfg`:  
      ```
      [include FanMatrix.cfg]
      ```

Your board should now be ready to use with Klipper! ðŸš€
